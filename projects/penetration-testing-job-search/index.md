# Penetration Testing Job Search Project

## Objective

In this project, my goal is to gain an understanding of the penetration testing job market by conducting a job search, analyzing the required qualifications, and identifying resources to help me further my career in ethical hacking. This project will give me practical experience in researching real-world job postings and the skills required to secure a penetration testing role.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Conduct a Penetration Tester Job Search**: I will search for relevant job postings related to penetration testing on various job boards. This will help me understand the job market and identify opportunities that match my skill set and career aspirations.
   
2. **Analyze Penetration Tester Job Requirements**: I will analyze the qualifications, skills, and certifications required for different penetration testing roles. This analysis will help me understand the key competencies needed to succeed in this career.

3. **Discover Resources to Further My Career**: I will explore available certifications, training programs, and other resources that can help me progress in the field of penetration testing. By identifying the most common certifications and training options, I will create a roadmap for my career development.
