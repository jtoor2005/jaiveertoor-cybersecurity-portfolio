# Biometric Authentication Ethics: Balancing Convenience, Consent, and Risk

📄 Final research project for **CPSC 329: Information Security and Privacy**  
📍 University of Calgary, Spring 2025  
👥 Team members: Kashfia Karder, Vianne Watson, Hsuan-Han Liu, Jaiveer Toor

## 🧠 Overview

This research project explores the **ethical, legal, and privacy challenges** of biometric authentication technologies. Using case studies on Clearview AI, India's Aadhaar system, and the U.S. CBP facial recognition program, the report critiques surveillance, consent, and security gaps.

## 🔍 Key Topics

- Algorithmic bias in facial recognition
- Biometric data retention and consent
- Cryptographic weaknesses in centralized systems
- Policy gaps around mass scraping and surveillance

## ✅ My Contribution

I contributed to:

- Writing the **policy recommendations and strategic insights** for the Clearview AI and Aadhaar case studies, which were originally researched and analyzed by another group member.
- Writing the **conclusion section** of the report, synthesizing insights from both case studies to highlight the ethical, legal, and technical challenges of biometric authentication systems.
- Ensuring consistency in messaging and language around key themes like **consent, transparency, and equitable access**.

Through this work, I gained a deeper understanding of how biometric systems, if not properly regulated, can undermine privacy rights and lead to long-term harm. Our group collaborated effectively by dividing sections early, sharing drafts and slide decks over group chat, and checking in regularly to keep each member aligned and accountable.
