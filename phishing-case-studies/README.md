# Phishing Case Studies

This folder contains three detailed phishing case studies I analyzed as part of my cybersecurity portfolio.  
Each case demonstrates email header analysis, indicators of compromise (IOCs), social engineering techniques, and recommended response actions.

## 📂 Case Studies

1. [Boss Impersonation via Gmail](case1_boss-impersonation.md)  
   *Business Email Compromise (BEC) attack impersonating a former supervisor to request WhatsApp details.*

2. [Fake Salary Increase PDF](case2_salary-increase-phish.md)  
   *Curiosity-based phishing attempt pretending to share a salary increase file.*

3. [Fake OneDrive T4 Tax Document](case3_t4-phish.md)  
   *Tax-season phishing attempt abusing Microsoft branding and urgency (“48-hour deletion” notice).*
