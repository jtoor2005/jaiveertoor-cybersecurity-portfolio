# Phishing Case Study: Fake Salary Increase PDF from ‚Äúcorp-internal.us‚Äù

## 1. Overview
In April 2025, I received an email on my **University of Calgary** address (`jaiveer.toor@ucalgary.ca`) with the subject:

> "File 'Your yearly salary increase.pdf' Has Been Shared With You"

The message pretended to share a document labeled as a salary update, exploiting curiosity and urgency to lure the recipient into clicking a link.

- **Domain:** `corp-internal.us` ‚Äî not affiliated with any known organization.
- **Tag:** `[‚ñ≥EXTERNAL]` warning was shown by the mail server.
- **Link Label:** ‚ÄúThis link will work for anyone‚Äù ‚Äî unusual for sensitive files.
