# Phishing Case Study: Fake OneDrive T4 Tax Document

## 1. Overview
In April 2025, I received a phishing email in my University of Calgary Outlook inbox impersonating Microsoft OneDrive. The message claimed that a document titled *‚ÄúUpdated T4‚Äù* (a Canadian tax slip) had been shared with me. The attacker attempted to use tax-related urgency to convince the recipient to click the ‚ÄúView Document Now‚Äù button.

## 4. Social Engineering Indicators
- **Tax lure:** Pretends to deliver an updated T4 tax slip (sensitive & time-sensitive).  
- **Brand abuse:** Uses fake Microsoft/OneDrive logos and formatting.  
- **Urgency:** States the document will be deleted after 48 hours.  
- **Impersonation:** Poses as the ‚ÄúOneDrive Team‚Äù to add legitimacy.  
- **Fear appeal:** Exploits anxiety about missing important tax forms.

## 5. Recommended Response Actions
- Report phishing to internal university IT and Microsoft (phish@office365.microsoft.com).  
- Block the typosquatting domain `onedrive-micrasoft.com` at the email gateway.  
- Train users on **tax-season phishing trends** (common in March‚ÄìApril).  
- Configure email security to flag lookalike domains more aggressively.  
- Enable MFA to reduce the impact of credential theft attempts.

## 6. Notes
Unlike Case 2 (salary increase), this phishing attempt specifically leveraged **tax season timing** to add credibility.  
No attachments were included ‚Äî the sole vector was a **malicious OneDrive-branded link** designed to harvest Microsoft 365 credentials.

## 7. Reporting & Action Taken
I forwarded the phishing email (with full headers) to:  
üìß **ReportPhishing@apwg.org**  

Also shared it with the **CyberSecurity Sensei Incident Response Team** for inclusion in training data. No links were clicked, and the phishing domain was reported for takedown.
