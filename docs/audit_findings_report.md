# IT Asset Audit Summary

This internal audit evaluated five IT assets across various departments to identify security and operational risks. Each asset was assessed based on antivirus status, patching date, administrative privileges, backup configuration, and business criticality.

## Key Findings
- 3 out of 5 assets were rated **High Risk**
- The highest contributors to risk were **missing backups**, **unpatched systems**, and **admin access**
- Departments with the highest cumulative risk scores included **Finance** and **R&D**

## Observations
- All high-risk assets lacked at least two critical controls
- Risk scores aligned strongly with lack of patch management and backup failures
- No assets in the **Marketing** department were rated high risk
